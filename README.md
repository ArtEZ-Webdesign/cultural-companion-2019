Semester 2

## Assignment

In this assignment, you will start out by visiting at least two art exhibitions, galleries or museums. You will analyse the exhibition and present your findings in class: who curated it and what is the curatorial concept? Who are the artists on display and how do their works interact?

Then, you will start developing a web-based, mobile-first companion app to the exhibition. This can be anything from a catalogue of the works on display to a new work that fits the curatorial concept.


## Goals

- Responding the design, arts and culture through the web
- Exploring the possibilities of the mobile web


## Roadmap

The assignment will run for the duration of the entire second semester. You are invited to schedule your time yourself, taking your visits to the exhibitions as a starting point and working towards a functional online platform by the end of the semester.

## Criteria
